Now that you got the hang out of time to SMACSS the heck out of sass.

CD into the sass-workshop directory that you cloned earlier.

<pre><code>$ git checkout ucsf_base
</code></pre>

This is a full fledged production project used by thousands of people. See if you can make it better by "SMACKEN" it up and maybe a little dash of BEM.

Look at the variables and mixins and see if you could possibly implement it better.
