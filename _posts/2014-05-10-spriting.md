Go to the folder "sass-workshop" you cloned before and checkout the spriting branch.

<pre><code>$ git checkout sprites
</code></pre>

One of the differences of Compass and Sass is that Compass has access to your file system. Thus giving the ability to manipulate icons and photos to create a sprite. A sprite consists of numerous icons compacted to one.
